By mandating the provision of instant credit transfers, the regulation seeks to enhance the competitiveness of European financial markets and improve the overall user experience for consumers and businesses."

  "2090347 - The-Importance-of-Reforming-the-EU-Benchmarks-Regulation.pdf": {
    "regulatorySummary": {
      "purpose": "The primary purpose of reforming the EU Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) is to address fundamental flaws that have positioned the regulation as a threat rather than a protective measure for benchmark users within the EU. The reform aims to align the BMR with global standards, ensuring that it provides proportionate protection to investors, imposes appropriate compliance burdens based on the significance of benchmarks, and maintains competitive fairness without unnecessary barriers.",
      "scope": "The scope of the proposed reforms is to narrow the mandatory compliance requirements to only systemic EU and third-country benchmarks. This shift aims to reduce the regulatory burden on less critical benchmarks, allowing for a voluntary compliance regime that encourages high standards without mandating them. The reform also seeks to enhance the visibility and accessibility of compliant benchmarks through improved registration and information dissemination processes.",
      "relevance": "The relevance of these reforms is significant in the context of global financial markets where benchmarks play a crucial role. By ensuring that the BMR is aligned with international practices, such as those adopted in the transition from LIBOR, the EU can protect its financial markets from disruptions caused by non-compliant benchmarks while fostering a competitive environment that is conducive to innovation and growth."
